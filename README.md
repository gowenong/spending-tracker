# spending-tracker
For personal spending tracking needs! Contains 4 main features:
  1. Can track total $ spent on any category, mode of payment, store name, and recurring payments (or all categories) over any period of time (give start and end date)
  2. Pie chart to show percentage spent on each category of spending (categories determined by self)
  3. Bar chart of spending over any period of time and any division of time, such as monthly for a year, but can also do weekly, every few months, etc
  4. Tracks average spending per month and also most expensive individual items purchased

In addition, you can specify categories or type of expenses to exclude in data analysis, so for example really large payments such as rent and tuition don't skew the data.
